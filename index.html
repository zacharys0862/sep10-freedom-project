<h1 class="title">My innovation: EcECU</h1>

<p class="tex">As the world modernizes and makes the switch to electric cars to be more envieromentally friendly, there is one problem with these electric cars, they don't have much character! In a gas car, you have a shifter, the sound of your engine and some people find that dramatic, what makes a gas car great. Compared to an electric car, everything is automatic, you dont even have a shifter and the car is dead silent. So thats why my innovation is the EcECU, a software that can be installed directly into the car to tune it like a regular, kind of like the MaxxECU I mentioned in my innovations section.</p>
